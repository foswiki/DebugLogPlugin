---++ Installation Instructions

You do not need to install anything in the browser to use this extension. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the extension on the server where TWiki is running.

Like many other TWiki extensions, this module is shipped with a fully
automatic installer script written using the Build<nop>Contrib.
   * If you have TWiki 4.2 or later, you can install from the =configure= interface (Go to Plugins->Find More Extensions)
      * See the [[http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/BuildContribInstallationSupplement][installation supplement]] on TWiki.org for more information.
   * If you have any problems, then you can still install manually from the command-line:
      1 Download one of the =.zip= or =.tgz= archives
      1 Unpack the archive in the root directory of your TWiki installation.
      1 Run the installer script ( =perl &lt;module&gt;_installer= )
      1 Run =configure= and enable the module, if it is a plugin.
      1 Repeat for any missing dependencies.
   * If you are *still* having problems, then instead of running the installer script:
      1 Make sure that the file permissions allow the webserver user to access all files.
      1 Check in any installed files that have existing =,v= files in your existing install (take care *not* to lock the files when you check in)
      1 Manually edit !LocalSite.cfg to set any configuration variables.
