---++ Usage
This Plugin allows a developer or admin to log all url parameters GETed or POSTed to foswiki. 
This can be useful both for debuging issues involving complex multi-request issues, or for gathering a dataset to be used for performance testing (as they can be replayed onto a existing backup).

It can gather performance information for individual MACRO's

---+++ output
Most of the information logged by this plugin is in its WorkDir. However, it also adds a =X-Foswiki-Rendertime= header to the HTTP response, that can be used as an approximation
of the time taken to render the entire request.

---++++ HTTP reposnse header =X-Foswiki-Monitor-DebugLogPlugin-Rendertime=
you can use 
=curl -I http://x61/f/bin/view/Lauries/TestQuery1= to get just the header info (foswiki goes through and does a complete render for =HEAD= requests atm.

---++ TO DO's
   1 rewrite as a Logger?

---++ Installation Instructions

You do not need to install anything in the browser to use this extension. The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the extension on the server where Foswiki is running.

Like many other Foswiki extensions, this module is shipped with a fully
automatic installer script written using the Build<nop>Contrib.
   * You can install from the =configure= interface (Go to Plugins->Find More Extensions)
      * See the [[http://foswiki.org/Extensions/BuildContribInstallationSupplement][installation supplement]] on foswiki.org for more information.
   * If you have any problems, then you can still install manually from the command-line:
      1 Download one of the =.zip= or =.tgz= archives
      1 Unpack the archive in the root directory of your Foswiki installation.
      1 Run the installer script ( =perl &lt;module&gt;_installer= )
      1 Run =configure= and enable the module, if it is a plugin.
      1 Repeat for any missing dependencies.
   * If you are *still* having problems, then instead of running the installer script:
      1 Make sure that the file permissions allow the webserver user to access all files.
      1 Check in any installed files that have existing =,v= files in your existing install (take care *not* to lock the files when you check in)
      1 Manually edit !LocalSite.cfg to set any configuration variables.
